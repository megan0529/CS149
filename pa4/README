We employed the following ideas:
1. OpenMP pragma: we parallized the middle for loop with dynamic scheduling, the
chunk size is 4. 

2. precalculating sin and cos: since the sin and cos calculation is the same for
many loops, we precalculated them and stored in an array

3. remove the filter. Since the filter is purely setting some matrix elements to
zero, this is done at the fft stage. Also we eliminated some calculation in ifft
since we know some elements are surely to be zero and no need to do calculation
on them.
